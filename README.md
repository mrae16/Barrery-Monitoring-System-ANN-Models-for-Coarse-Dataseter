# Barrery-Monitoring-System-ANN-Models-for-Coarse-Datasetets
three Artificial neural network models (MLP, LSTM, and NARX) for predicting SOC of Li-ion batteries 

The models in this dataset are from the publication by Rae et al found here at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2025.236929. use of this code should be appropriately cited. 

The models have "yourDatset" as a placeholder for the data to be put into the models. The dataset can be found at https://zenodo.org/records/13361914 from the associated paper by Rae et al (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2025.236929).
